				<p>
				  With over 7 years of experience, I’ve built my career as a UX Designer and IT professional by focusing on people first. Whether it’s logistics, banking, or IT support, my goal has always been to create solutions that are meaningful and practical. I believe great design isn’t just about how something looks—it’s about how it works and how it solves real problems.
				
				  One project I’m particularly proud of is designing a web app for managing Office365 accounts at GEODIS. It automated processes, eliminated nearly all human errors, and connected HR and IT data seamlessly. As a team lead, I’ve guided a global IT team, introduced new processes, and helped ensure our work met real-world user needs. I also turned confusing HR system logs into something useful, helping teams make sense of their data and work more efficiently.
				
				  What drives me most is connecting with users, understanding their challenges, and turning those insights into designs that make their lives easier. Outside of work, I dedicate part of my time to volunteering as a UX consultant for non-profits. It’s taught me to get creative with limited resources while staying focused on delivering meaningful results.

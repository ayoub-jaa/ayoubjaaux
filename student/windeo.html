					<h2>About my role in this project and my global feeling</h2>
					<p>
						As Intern UX Designer at BoursoBank, I had opportunity to work with 2 distinct teams :
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>âœ… As Principal UX Designer (for 6 months) </strong>for the Customer Service : my intership allow Bourso Bank to recruit a resource for the customer service (until my arrival, the Infography team were almost totally allocated to the Marketing Department only.</li>
						<li>
							<strong>âœ… As UX Designer (for 1 month) </strong>
							in the UX Team of the Marketing Dept. : at the end of my internship, I worked on 2-3 project.
							<strong><br /></strong>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						I had 2 challenges here : undestand the bank domain and users' needs &amp; apply my UX skills after my Master's Degree. Fortunately, I had a great team and my internship was a success.
					</p>
					<section id="problem-statement">
						<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
						<p>
							After some studies made by my former colleagues, we saw that the offers displayed in BoursoShop (a platform for some discounts reserved to BoursoBank clients) are not very good, espacially with multiple offers. The users were terribly borred when they use this features via smartphone
						</p>
						<p>
							&nbsp;
						</p>
						<!-- Capture d'Ã©cran de l'ancien outil -->
						<div class="problem-screenshot">
							<img src="/assets/images/bs-avant.jpg" alt="Previous Boursoshop display" />
						</div>
					</section>
					<h2 id="challenges">Challenges and Context</h2>
					<p>
						Until then and with this bad display, the limitation of products displayed in a row was 3. To make the customer using this feature more, we had to found a solution to display the offers and make the smartphone display more usable.
					</p>
					<h2 id="user">User Research and Needs Gathering</h2>
					<p>
						To design a tool that truly meets the users' needs, we conducted a series of research activities to better understand the daily challenges faced by both users and marketing department. We had discussions with 2 members of marketing department, a confirmed UX Designer, and 2 clients.
					</p>
					<h3><u>Our User Research Approach</u></h3>
					<p>
						To gather precise feedback, we used several research methods, ranging from individual interviews to collaborative workshops. Here&rsquo;s an overview of the steps we took:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>âœ… User Interviews:</strong> We conducted in-depth interviews with users from diverse demographics, including students, seniors, engineers, and marketing professionals at BoursoBank. These sessions focused on understanding their needs, frustrations, and expectations regarding offer navigation and visibility, particularly on mobile platforms.</li>
						<li><strong>âœ… Collaborative Workshops:</strong> Cross-functional workshops brought together design, marketing, and development teams to align on user priorities and explore creative solutions for displaying multiple offers.</li>
						<li><strong>âœ… Surveys:</strong> Surveys targeted a wider audience to gather quantitative insights about user preferences for offer presentation and their likelihood to interact with carousels or other display methods.</li>
						<li><strong>âœ… Process Audit:</strong> An audit of existing tools and workflows revealed constraints in marketing's ability to scale beyond three offers, limiting future growth opportunities.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3><u>What We Learned</u></h3>
					<p>
						Through this research, several recurring issues emerged:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>âœ… Limited Offer Visibility:</strong> Users struggled to view and compare multiple offers, especially on smaller mobile screens.</li>
						<li><strong>âœ… Fragmented Navigation Experience:</strong> Switching between offers was cumbersome, leading to frustration and lower engagement rates.</li>
						<li><strong>âœ… Marketing Scalability Challenges:</strong> The existing structure restricted marketing teams from efficiently promoting more than three offers at a time, hindering flexibility and innovation.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3><u>User Personas</u></h3>
					<p>
						To better understand the different types of users, we created personas. These profiles allowed us to define the specific needs and goals of each user group and tailor the tool to their objectives.

						<h2>User Journey Mapping</h2>
						<p>The user journey for Windeo is simple and focused on displaying relevant outdoor temperature information directly on the window. Users do not need to interact actively with the system, but instead, they rely on the display to guide their decision on how to dress for the day. The experience is designed to be seamless, with the window providing an immediate and intuitive way to gather essential information.</p>

						<h2>Solution & Features</h2>
						<p>The goal of the Windeo project was to create a smart window display system that provides users with real-time weather data and clothing recommendations. The idea was to leverage the window as a passive, non-interactive display, making it easy for users to quickly glance and gather the information they need before heading outside. The primary objectives were to:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Integrate a Raspberry Pi and Arduino to display weather data on a window using a mini projector.</li>
							<li>Provide real-time temperature and clothing suggestions based on the weather conditions.</li>
							<li>Ensure the information was easily readable and accessible, with clear and intuitive recommendations.</li>
							<li>Design a simple yet effective user interface that didnâ€™t require any interaction, making it suitable for all users, including children and the elderly.</li>
							<li>Create a practical solution that could be implemented on any window, regardless of size or location.</li>
							<li>Depending on your distance, you will have more or less information displayed, with Arduino we added a sensor for distance calculation.</li>
						</ul>

					<h2 id="results">Test, Impact and Results</h2>
					<p>
						The Windeo project successfully integrated embedded technology with everyday life, offering users an intuitive way to check weather information and receive clothing recommendations directly on their window. The simplicity of the interface, paired with the novelty of projecting information on the window, provided a seamless experience for users, helping them make informed decisions before going outside.
					</p>
					<h3>Test Methodology</h3>
					<p>
						The project was tested by displaying weather data and clothing recommendations on a window using a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino setup. We tested the system with a variety of users, focusing on how effectively the window display communicated the relevant information and how easily users could interpret it without any interaction.
					</p>
					<h3>User Feedback</h3>
					<p>
						Users appreciated the simplicity and convenience of the system. They found it especially helpful to receive immediate, visible information on the window without having to look at a screen or phone. The recommendation to dress accordingly based on the weather was well-received and felt like a practical addition to the experience.
					</p>
					<h3>Challenges</h3>
					<p>
						One of the main challenges faced was ensuring the visibility and legibility of the projected information under different lighting conditions. Additionally, while the technology worked well in controlled environments, further testing was needed to optimize it for outdoor use under varying weather conditions.
					</p>
					<h3>Key Improvements</h3>
					<p>
						Improvements were made in optimizing the display for different times of the day, ensuring readability under varying light levels. Additionally, the Python code for the weather data was refined to provide more accurate and localized recommendations.
					</p>
					<h3>Impact</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>âœ… The project received the highest grade in the class, a recognition of the innovative use of embedded technology.</li>
						<li>âœ… The system was showcased at the Hackathon 2018, where it received positive feedback, although we did not win.</li>
						<li>âœ… Despite not winning, the team gained valuable experience in presenting and defending an innovative product in a competitive setting.</li>
						<li>âœ… The project significantly improved the understanding of how embedded systems can be seamlessly integrated into daily life to aid decision-making.</li>
					</ul>

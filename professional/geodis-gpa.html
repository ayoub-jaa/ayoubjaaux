                <h2>About my role in this project and my global feeling</h2>
                <p>
                    I started my journey at GEODIS as both Level L2/L3 Analyst for Identity and Access Management (IAM) & HR, as well as a UX Designer between November 2018 & October 2022. As the principal UX Designer, I faced various challenges:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Junior UX Designer:</strong> While I had a strong foundation from my time at BoursoBank, it was a learning curve in a new domain.</li>
                    <li><strong>New domain:</strong> I had limited experience with LDAP and HR systems before joining GEODIS.</li>
                    <li><strong>Understanding the scope:</strong> Grasping the interaction between IAM & HR data was a challenge that required constant learning and iteration.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Despite the challenges, today I am both an expert in IAM & HR data management and a skilled UX Designer. The "Office365 Account Provisioning" project was designed during the COVID-19 pandemic, from March to September 2020, and I followed the development from October 2020 to January 2021. The first deployment was in France in March 2021, and the application has since been rolled out worldwide, with the US set for 2025-2026.
                </p>

                <section id="problem-statement">
					<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
					<p>
						We identified issues with data quality in Office 365 directories. 
						Admins were inputting incorrect data, there was little control over licensing costs, and GEODIS' ecosystem 
						was not well-integrated. Our goal was to streamline the provisioning of Office 365 accounts, automate the 
						process, and improve data accuracy by syncing data from the HR system.
					</p>
					
					<p><strong>Previous Tool: AD Admin Interface</strong></p>
					<p>The previous admin interface was complex and lacked validation controls, allowing administrators to easily input incorrect data. The lack of integration with the HR system meant manual synchronization and a high risk of errors. The following screenshot shows the interface that was used before the new application was implemented.</p>

                <h2 id="challenges">Challenges and Context</h2>
                <p>
                    Before the solution, data synchronization between HR and IT teams was done manually, often via email, leading to inefficiencies and a lack of traceability. The process was inconsistent across regions. Our solution centralized these processes, offering a unified platform for account creation, license management, and data accuracy.
                </p>

                <h2 id="user">User Research and Needs Gathering</h2>
				<p>
					To design a tool that truly meets the users' needs, we conducted a series of research activities to better understand the daily challenges faced by those using or managing Office365 accounts. We had insightful discussions with administrators, HR managers, and team leads to identify their pain points and expectations.
				</p>

				<h3><u>Our User Research Approach</u></h3>
				<p>
					To gather precise feedback, we used several research methods, ranging from individual interviews to collaborative workshops. Hereâ€™s an overview of the steps we took:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li><strong>User Interviews:</strong> We interviewed Office365 administrators and HR managers to better understand their needs and the challenges they face when managing accounts.</li>
					<li><strong>Collaborative Workshops:</strong> We organized workshops with stakeholders to co-create solutions and prioritize features critical to their workflows.</li>
					<li><strong>Surveys:</strong> We distributed surveys to gather a broader perspective on the issues encountered by a larger number of users.</li>
					<li><strong>Process Audit:</strong> We analyzed current processes to identify inefficiencies and pain points that the new tool should address.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3><u>What We Learned</u></h3>
				<p>
					Through this research, several recurring issues emerged:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li><strong>Long and error-prone manual processes:</strong> Administrators spent a lot of time manually entering data, which led to errors and inefficiencies.</li>
					<li><strong>Lack of integration with HR systems:</strong> The absence of a connection between HR data and Office365 led to inconsistencies, requiring users to manually sync data.</li>
					<li><strong>High error rate:</strong> Many users made mistakes during data entry, as the system lacked sufficient validation checks.</li>
					<li><strong>Strong need for automation:</strong> Users expressed a clear desire for a system that could automate account creation, license management, and expiration notifications.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3><u>User Personas</u></h3>
				<p>
					To better understand the different types of users, we created personas. These profiles allowed us to define the specific needs and goals of each user group and tailor the tool to their objectives.

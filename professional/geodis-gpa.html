			<h2>About my role in this project and my global feeling</h2>
			<p>
				I stared my journey at GEODIS as both Level L2/L3 Analyst Identity and Access Management (IAM) & HR and UX Designer between November 2018 & October 2022. For the the UX part, I was the principal UX Designer at GEODIS, it was complicated because: 
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>I was junior UX : I had a very great experience at BoursoBank also as Principal UX Designer for the Customer Service, then team member of the Marketing, but I still had/have to learn.</li>
				<li>New domain : Before GEODIS, I had a little experience in LDAP (directory) and no experience in HR scope</li>
				<li>Comprehension of the scopes and interaction between them</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				It was difficult but today I'm both expert in IAM&HR data management and UX Designer. The application "Office365 Account Provisioning" has been designed during the Covid19 pandemic, between March & September 2020. Then I followed the development between October and January 2021. The first go live was in March 2021 only in France, and has been deployed between 2021 until today in the whole world, expect the US (will be made between 2025-2026).
			</p>
			<h2 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h2>
			<p>
				We identified issues with data quality in Office 365 directories. 
				Admins were inputting incorrect data, there was little control over licensing costs, and GEODIS' ecosystem 
				was not well-integrated. Our goal was to streamline the provisioning of Office 365 accounts, automate the 
				process, and improve data accuracy by syncing data from the HR system.
			</p>
			<h2 id="challenges">Challenges and Context</h2>
			<p>
				Before the solution, HR and IT teams had to manually synchronize data, often via email, which led to 
				inefficiencies and lack of traceability. Teams in different regions followed different processes. Our application 
				centralized everything, offering a unified tool for managing account creation, license management, and data accuracy.
			</p>
			<h2 id="user">User Research and Needs Gathering</h2>
			<p>
				Working in the IAM team, I was able to identify the key stakeholders: HR managers, Office 365 admins, and 
				external users. Through workshops and interviews with admins and managers, we identified the core needs 
				of the users and the required features, such as account creation, license management, and automatic expiration 
				of external accounts. We also conducted an audit of the existing processes.
			</p>
			<h2 id="design-process">Design Process</h2>
			<p>
				I used Adobe Photoshop to design the screens to ensure flexibility in adhering to GEODIS' branding guidelines. 
				Afterward, I imported the designs into Adobe XD to build interactive prototypes. These prototypes were 
				presented to key stakeholders for feedback, and we iterated on the design accordingly. The application was built 
				from the ground up, following Google's Material Design principles.
			</p>
			<h2 id="solution">Solution & Features</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Pre-filled internal data from the HR system to minimize errors.</li>
				<li>Admin interface for creating internal and external accounts, with license and cost tracking.</li>
				<li>Manager notifications for account expiration and account extension for external users.</li>
				<li>Creation and management of shared and generic accounts, including a naming convention.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="results">Impact and Results</h2>
			<p>
				After implementation, we saw excellent results. The application streamlined account provisioning, 
				improved data accuracy, and allowed for better control over licensing costs. We reduced incidents related 
				to data quality by 97% and standardized processes across all regions. The satisfaction rate from users increased 
				from 85% in 2022 to 92% in 2024. We continue to improve the tool iteratively, adding new features and enhancing 
				its usability.
			</p>
			<h2 id="tools">Tools Used</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Balsamiq Mockups for quick screen design.</li>
				<li>Photoshop for screen design and branding.</li>
				<li>Adobe XD for prototyping and interaction design.</li>
				<li>Material Design for UI components.</li>
				<li>ServiceNow for ITSM incident management.</li>

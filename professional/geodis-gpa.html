                <h2>About my role in this project and my global feeling</h2>
                <p>
                    I started my journey at GEODIS as both Level L2/L3 Analyst for Identity and Access Management (IAM) & HR, as well as a UX Designer between November 2018 & October 2022. As the principal UX Designer, I faced various challenges:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Junior UX Designer: While I had a strong foundation from my time at BoursoBank, it was a learning curve in a new domain.</li>
                    <li>New domain: I had limited experience with LDAP and HR systems before joining GEODIS.</li>
                    <li>Understanding the scope: Grasping the interaction between IAM & HR data was a challenge that required constant learning and iteration.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Despite the challenges, today I am both an expert in IAM & HR data management and a skilled UX Designer. The "Office365 Account Provisioning" project was designed during the COVID-19 pandemic, from March to September 2020, and I followed the development from October 2020 to January 2021. The first deployment was in France in March 2021, and the application has since been rolled out worldwide, with the US set for 2025-2026.

					<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
					<p>
						We identified issues with data quality in Office 365 directories. 
						Admins were inputting incorrect data, there was little control over licensing costs, and GEODIS' ecosystem 
						was not well-integrated. Our goal was to streamline the provisioning of Office 365 accounts, automate the 
						process, and improve data accuracy by syncing data from the HR system.
					</p>
					
					<p><strong>Previous Tool: AD Admin Interface</strong></p>
					<p>The previous admin interface was complex and lacked validation controls, allowing administrators to easily input incorrect data. The lack of integration with the HR system meant manual synchronization and a high risk of errors. The following screenshot shows the interface that was used before the new application was implemented.</p>

                <h2 id="challenges">Challenges and Context</h2>
                <p>
                    Before the solution, data synchronization between HR and IT teams was done manually, often via email, leading to inefficiencies and a lack of traceability. The process was inconsistent across regions. Our solution centralized these processes, offering a unified platform for account creation, license management, and data accuracy.
                </p>

                <h2 id="user">User Research and Needs Gathering</h2>
                <p>
                    Working closely with the IAM team, we identified key stakeholders such as HR managers, Office 365 admins, and external users. Through workshops and interviews with admins and managers, we gathered core user needs: account creation, license management, and automatic account expiration for external users. Additionally, an audit of existing processes revealed areas for improvement.
                </p>

                <h2 id="design-process">Design Process</h2>
                <p>
                    I used Adobe Photoshop for designing initial screens to ensure flexibility with GEODIS' branding guidelines. These designs were then transferred to Adobe XD to create interactive prototypes. The prototypes were shared with key stakeholders for feedback, and we iterated based on their input. The application was built from scratch, following Google's Material Design principles.
                </p>

                <h2 id="solution">Solution & Features</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pre-filled internal data from the HR system to minimize errors.</li>
                    <li>Admin interface for creating internal and external accounts, with license and cost tracking.</li>
                    <li>Manager notifications for account expiration and automatic account extension for external users.</li>
                    <li>Creation and management of shared and generic accounts, including naming conventions.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="results">Impact and Results</h2>
                <p>
                    The application successfully streamlined account provisioning, improved data accuracy, and provided better control over licensing costs. We reduced data quality-related incidents by 97% and standardized processes across all regions. User satisfaction increased from 85% in 2022 to 92% in 2024. The tool is continuously improved, with new features being added iteratively to enhance usability.

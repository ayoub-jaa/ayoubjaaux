        <div class="project-details">
            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>
                As part of the IT and IAM team at GEODIS, we identified issues with data quality in Office 365 directories. 
                Admins were inputting incorrect data, there was little control over licensing costs, and GEODIS' ecosystem 
                was not well-integrated. Our goal was to streamline the provisioning of Office 365 accounts, automate the 
                process, and improve data accuracy by syncing data from the HR system.
            </p>
            <h3>Challenges and Context</h3>
            <p>
                Before the solution, HR and IT teams had to manually synchronize data, often via email, which led to 
                inefficiencies and lack of traceability. Teams in different regions followed different processes. Our application 
                centralized everything, offering a unified tool for managing account creation, license management, and data accuracy.
            </p>
            <h3>User Research and Needs Gathering</h3>
            <p>
                Working in the IAM team, I was able to identify the key stakeholders: HR managers, Office 365 admins, and 
                external users. Through workshops and interviews with admins and managers, we identified the core needs 
                of the users and the required features, such as account creation, license management, and automatic expiration 
                of external accounts. We also conducted an audit of the existing processes.
            </p>
            <h3>Design Process</h3>
            <p>
                I used Adobe Photoshop to design the screens to ensure flexibility in adhering to GEODIS' branding guidelines. 
                Afterward, I imported the designs into Adobe XD to build interactive prototypes. These prototypes were 
                presented to key stakeholders for feedback, and we iterated on the design accordingly. The application was built 
                from the ground up, following Google's Material Design principles.
            </p>
            <h3>Solution & Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Pre-filled internal data from the HR system to minimize errors.</li>
                <li>Admin interface for creating internal and external accounts, with license and cost tracking.</li>
                <li>Manager notifications for account expiration and account extension for external users.</li>
                <li>Creation and management of shared and generic accounts, including a naming convention.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Impact and Results</h3>
            <p>
                After implementation, we saw excellent results. The application streamlined account provisioning, 
                improved data accuracy, and allowed for better control over licensing costs. We reduced incidents related 
                to data quality by 97% and standardized processes across all regions. The satisfaction rate from users increased 
                from 85% in 2022 to 92% in 2024. We continue to improve the tool iteratively, adding new features and enhancing 
                its usability.
            </p>
            <h3>Tools Used</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Photoshop for screen design and branding.</li>
                <li>Adobe XD for prototyping and interaction design.</li>
                <li>Material Design for UI components.</li>
